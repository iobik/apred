        1. What the index means (like.. "Educational Equity".. what is it?) Why is this measure part of this index?
        2. How the score was computed. Datasources, and math involved to compute it (score should be fully reproducible from the data source)
        3. Information about how to improve the score. Where should they invest, and how much money does it require to improve the score by 1% - even if it's just a guestimate.
